      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Hunterr helps founders build their dream teams by sharing open roles at early-stage startups. Whether you're a founder looking for collaborators or a builder searching for something meaningful to join, Startup Board makes the connection easy.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Founders sign in and post their startup, including roles they need help with.</li>
        <li>Visitors can browse startups and see what roles are open, taken, or already applied for.</li>
        <li>If a role interests you, sign in and click "Apply" to let the founder know you're interested.</li>
        <li>The founder gets an email about your application and can confirm you with a single click.</li>
        <li>Once confirmed, you're officially part of the startupâ€”go build something awesome together!</li>
      </ol>
